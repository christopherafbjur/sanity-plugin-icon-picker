## Installation

```sh
npm install sanity-plugin-icon-picker
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "sanity";
import { iconPicker } from "sanity-plugin-icon-picker";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  plugins: [iconPicker()],
});
```

Use the type in your schemas.

```js
{
    title: "Icon",
    name: "icon",
    type: "iconPicker"
}
```

## Options

### Providers

Define which icon providers you want to use by providing their provider id in the `providers` array. If not defined, the Icon Picker defaults to display all providers and icons.

```js
{
    title: "Icon",
    name: "icon",
    type: "iconPicker",
    options: {
        providers: ["f7", "fa", "mdi", "sa", "hi", "fi", "si"]
    }
}
```

### Output Format

Format the output data in accordance with your front-end project. If you're using React you can set the `outputFormat` to `react`. If you ommit this option, the output format will be in accordance with every single provider's icon naming convention.

```js
{
    title: "Icon",
    name: "icon",
    type: "iconPicker",
    options: {
        outputFormat: 'react',
    }
}
```

### Filter

Filter out a subset of icons to be used by specifying a filter. A filter can be either an exact match of a string (case insensitive) or a regular expression. Supports both the react naming convention of an icon name as well as default naming conventions for each icon provider. This means that defining for instance the Font Awesome icon `arrow-circle-up` is equal to defining the react version `FaArrowCircleUp`.

```js
{
    title: "Icon",
    name: "icon",
    type: "iconPicker",
    options: {
        filter: ['FaBeer', 'FaDocker', /^arrow/i],
    }
}
```

## Helper functions

In order to render the icon component as preview media, we can import a helper method.

```js
import { preview } from "sanity-plugin-icon-picker";
```

We can then render the icon by passing the selected name and provider to this method which will return an icon component.

```js
{
...
    preview: {
        select: {
          provider: "icon.provider",
          name: "icon.name",
        },
        prepare(icon) {
          return {
            title: icon.provider,
            subtitle: icon.name,
            media: preview(icon),
          };
        },
      }
}
```

## FAQ

### Can I use this plugin for Sanity Studio v2?

Yes you can! Simply install the older version of this plugin

```sh
npm install sanity-plugin-icon-picker@2.1.0
```

Then refer to the [old documentation](https://github.com/christopherafbjur/sanity-plugin-icon-picker/blob/72ba11830b73b729b6b3c1c254bde3c686032972/README.md) and follow everything except the install step.

### How can I consume the data returned from Sanity Studio in my React app?

Here's a really simple example of how you could consume the data to render a Font Awesome icon from it. Note that in this example I'm using the option `outputFormat: 'react'` for the icon picker in the studio as mentioned [here](https://github.com/christopherafbjur/sanity-plugin-icon-picker#output-format).

```js
import * as Icons from "react-icons/fa";

// Sanity data mock
const data = {
  _type: "iconPicker",
  name: "FaBeer",
  provider: "fa",
  _updatedAt: "2021-07-25T02:30:43.141Z",
};

const DynamicFontAwesomeIcon = ({ name }) => Icons[name];

export default function App() {
  const Icon = DynamicFontAwesomeIcon(data);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Icon />
    </div>
  );
}
```
